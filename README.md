# Predict-the-Area-Size-of-Future-Forest-Fire
## COMP5318 Machine Learning - Assignment 2
Sep 2020 - Oct 2020


The forest fire has a huge impact on public well-being. Predict the area size of future forest fire is necessary for the public benefit. The study has applied three machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forest Polynomial (RFP), to forecast the area size of the fire. Considering the overall mean absolute error and computational cost, the SVR model is considered as the most proper algorithm for such prediction.
