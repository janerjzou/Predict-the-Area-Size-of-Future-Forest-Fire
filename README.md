# Predict-the-Area-Size-of-Future-Forest-Fire
## COMP5318 Machine Learning - Assignment2
SEP 2020 - OCT 2020


The aim of the project is to apply analytic skills and machine learning algorithms to predict the potential area size of the forest fire in the future.

* EDA
* Data pre-processing
* Built the regression model by using SVR machine learning algorithm.
